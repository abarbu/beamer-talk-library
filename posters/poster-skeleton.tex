        \vspace*{-1.3ex}
        We collected a large dataset of 12,000 images where subjects hold 150
        objects. Images were collected of the same hands both occluded by the
        object they are holding and unoccluded. Each hold was natural and
        subjects were asked to hold each object many times in different
        ways. The resulting images show the brittleness of current computer
        vision in the face of occlusion: mild
        occlusion leads to incorrect hand-pose estimations.\\
